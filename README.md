# Split one file into multiple files based on a columns with Streamlit 

## What is Streamlit?

Streamlit is an open-source Python library that enables you to create web applications.

## Description

The SÃ£o Paulo State Department of Education (SEDUC-SP) has 91 regional administrative units (DEs),
which are responsible for managing all the state public schools. One of the challenges faced by SEDUC-SP
is that the IT team usually creates files with data per DE in one single file. In order to send the 
data separatly to each DE, it was necessary to split into 91 files. In this context, I created this
application to automatize this task.

## How can you use this application?

1. Access the application [here](https://leofyada-de-heroku-programa-de-lsy865.streamlit.app).
2. Click on "Browse files" and select the file you want to split (choose a .csv or .xlsx file with the first column being the DE identification). 
3. Choose the final name for each file. It starts with the name of the first column.
